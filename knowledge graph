To display a network graph generated with the pyvis library in a Jupyter Notebook, you need to make use of the show method provided by pyvis. 
This method creates an HTML file and opens it in a web browser, or it can be embedded directly in a Jupyter Notebook.

Here is an example of how to create and display a network graph using pyvis:
1.Install pyvis: pip install pyvis

2.Create and display the network graph:

from pyvis.network import Network
from IPython.core.display import display, HTML

# Create a network
net = Network()

# Add nodes and edges
net.add_node(1, label='Node 1')
net.add_node(2, label='Node 2')
net.add_edge(1, 2)

# Generate the HTML file
net.show('graph.html')

# Display the HTML file in Jupyter Notebook
with open('graph.html', 'r') as file:
    html_content = file.read()

display(HTML(html_content))
